<h1>CYBER ATTACKS</h1>
<h2>Phishing scams:</h2>
<p><b>Phishing</b> is one of the main forms of social engineering attacks, and as any social engineering attack it tries to trick unsuspecting users into giving away personal information.</p>
<p>Usually, these cybercrimes are committed by impersonating trusted and popular brands creating fake social media profiles and rogue websites to lure users into them. These sites copy the appearance of the real website to create a sense of security and usually ask to fill forms with personal information to receive some kind of benefit, such as discounts. The most refined of these sites might include malicious scripts that scrap this information out of your browser, without the need of forms.</p>
<h3>How to stay safe from phishing scams:</h3>
<p>You should be checking every domain that you get links to and do not provide any kind of information on websites that are not secure, secure websites always display a little padlock at the start of the URL.</p>
<p>Of course, applying common sense is very important too against these scams. If it’s too good to be true, it usually isn’t.
From a business standpoint, instruct and educate your employees, since ultimately it comes to individuals to stay safe from this type of cybercrimes.</p>
<h2>Internet fraud:</h2>
<p>This type of scam usually asks people to send money promising a much larger sum in the short term. The most famous one is the “Nigerian” scam, also known as the “419” scam which is the number of the nigerian law it violates.</p>
<p>These scams were already widespread through fax, telephone and traditional mail, but the Internet made them much easier to pull off and more widespread.
Usually the victim receives communication from someone in need of help to move a large sum of money from a foreign country. There are plenty of variations of this scam and more are developed each day.</p>
<p>The victim will be asked to cover a small portion of the cost of moving the money or asset, and will be promised a bigger cut of the benefits when the process is over.
If the victim falls for it and transfers money, he or she will be told that complications have arisen and that more money will be required. Of course, the victim will not recover anything and this will go on until the scammer feels like there’s nothing to gain from this victim and jump to another one.</p>
<p>Another common fraud is related to fake job listings, where the victim is asked to pay some money to cover the cost of paperwork or pre onboarding formation.</p>
<h3>How to stay safe from Internet fraud:</h3>
<p>Common sense is our best defense against this type of cybercrime, as with fishing scams, if an offer is too good to be true, it usually isn’t true.
Distrust unsolicited communications from strangers offering very attractive deals, and never pay in advance any of these.</p>
